- Fixed a bug in "Hashdump and upload to pastebin" payload. The powershell command was being called from the dumpaste.vbs script without bypassing executionpolicy. This means password hashes were being dumped but not pasted to pastebin..
- Removed TYPESPEED from every payload which was being used as good luck mark and was borrowed from SET :)
